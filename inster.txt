Areas for UI/UX Improvement
1. Navigation & Hierarchy

The Sign-In CTA is present, but more visible CTAs like Get Started or Free Trial above the fold would improve conversion.

Use consistent navigation patterns so users don’t have to hunt for primary actions.

2. Interaction Feedback

Add instant feedback on interactive elements (button hover, form submission, auto-save indicators) to reassure users after each action.

3. Mobile & Responsiveness

Ensure consistent responsive layouts — especially for analytics charts and status summary cards — to maintain readability across devices.

4. User Guidance

New users may need quick onboarding hints or small tooltips to understand each module’s workflow.

Micro-interactions for status updates (e.g., request assignment) significantly boost clarity.

5. Visual Consistency

Use consistent font sizes, colors, and iconography throughout for branding strength and easy recognition.
